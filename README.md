## About the Game:

My project is based on the theme of 8-bit spaceship games, from the 80's, where I used the **Star Wars** universe, as a fan of that universe.
I used engine and ship game engines with "gravity", where we need to press some "key" or "click" of the mouse so that the "little ship" does not fall or collide with obstacles!

## About the Creator:

I am graduated in Computer Networks, game enthusiast, nerd, and learning and studying at **IronHack** school about programming and web development.
